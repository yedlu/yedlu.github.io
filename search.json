When \\(n=1\\), let \\(v^1 = 0\\) and \\(\\alpha^1 = 1\\). Suppose this is true when we have \\(n\\) choices. Now, denote \\(x^{n+1}\\) as \\(x^{n+1} \\not\\succ^R x^i\\) for every \\(i\\). We can imply from the assumption that this statement is true for observation \\(1, ..., n\\) that:\n\\[\\exists \\, v^1, ..., v^n \\in \\mathbb{R} \\quad \\exists \\, \\alpha^1, ..., \\alpha^n &gt; 0 \\quad \\forall i, j \\quad v^i \\leq v^j + \\alpha^j [p^j x^i - p^j x^j].\\]\nDefine: \\(v^{n+1} = \\min_{1 \\leq j \\leq n} v^j + \\alpha^j [p^j x^{n+1} - p^j x^j]\\). Since \\(|\\{x^k: x^{n+1} \\succ^R x^k\\}| = 0\\), we can say that \\(p^{n+1} x^j \\geq m^{n+1} = p^{n+1} x^{n+1}\\) for every \\(1 \\leq j \\leq n\\).\nWe assert that for \\(1 \\leq j \\leq n\\), either \\(p^{n+1} x^j &gt; m^{n+1} = p^{n+1} x^{n+1}\\) or \\(p^{n+1} x^j = m^{n+1} = p^{n+1} x^{n+1}\\) holds.\n\nIf \\(p^{n+1} x^j &gt; m^{n+1} = p^{n+1} x^{n+1}\\), \\(p^{n+1} x^j - p^{n+1} x^{n+1} &gt; 0\\). Then there exists \\(\\alpha^{n+1} &gt; 0\\) large enough such that \\(v^j \\leq v^{n+1} + \\alpha^{n+1} [p^{n+1} x^j - p^{n+1} x^{n+1}]\\) holds.\n\nIf \\(p^{n+1} x^j = m^{n+1} = p^{n+1} x^{n+1}\\), \\(p^{n+1} x^j - p^{n+1} x^{n+1} = 0\\).\n\nThen, as long as \\(\\alpha^{n+1} \\in \\mathbb{R}_{++}\\), \\(v^j \\leq v^{n+1} + \\alpha^{n+1} [p^{n+1} x^j - p^{n+1} x^{n+1}] = v^{n+1}\\) holds.\n\n\nLet \\(u(x) := \\min_{1 \\leq j \\leq n} v^i + \\alpha^i [p^i x - p^i x^i]\\).\n\nIntuition: this function yields a concave form.",

First, we write down the expected SDF under contingent claim pricing:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  \\E[m] &= \\sum_{s \\in S} \\pi(s) m(s) \\\\\n  &= \\sum_{s \\in S} \\pi(s) \\frac{pc(s)}{\\pi(s)} \\\\\n  &= \\sum_{s \\in S} pc(s)\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nThen, using the finding from consumption pricing on risk-free rate, we have:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  R^f &= \\frac{1}{\\E[m]} \\\\\n  &= \\frac{1}{\\sum_{s \\in S} pc(s)}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nIntuition\nWe know from the definition of risk-free asset that its payoff vector would look like:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  \\mathcal{A} &= (1, ..., 1)^{'} \\in \\R^n\n\\end{aligned}\\] given state set \\(S = (s_1, ..., s_n)\\).\nIf we were to assume complete markets, then the risk-free asset with the said payoff would have price:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  p(\\mathcal{A}) &= \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} pc(s_i)\n\\end{aligned}\\] The return of investing this asset would be \\(1/\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} pc(s_i) = R^f\\).\n\n\nDefinition: Risk-Neutral Probabilities\nWe define:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  \\pi^* (s) &:= R^f m(s) \\pi(s) \\\\\n  &= R^f pc(s) \\\\\n  &= \\frac{pc(s)}{\\sum_{s \\in S} pc(s)}\n\\end{aligned}\\] as the risk-neutral probability of state \\(s \\in S\\).\n\n\nRisk-Neutral Pricing\nUnder risk-neutral probabilities, we can derive further the contingent claim pricing model:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  p(x) &= \\sum_{s \\in S} pc(s) x(s) \\\\\n  &= \\sum_{s \\in S} \\frac{\\pi^* (s)}{R^f} x(s) \\\\\n  &= \\frac{\\E^*[x]}{R^f}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nWhere \\(\\E^*\\) is the expected payoff under risk-neutral probabilities.\n\n\nLinking Two Probabilities\nAlthough investors might have disagreements over the real probability, they must all agree on one set of risk-neutral probabilities. Rationale would be:\n\nall investors observe the same asset price;\nall investors infer and agree the same contingent claim prices\n\nThen, by the definition of risk-neutral probabilities:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  \\pi^* (s) &= \\frac{pc(s)}{\\sum_{s \\in S} pc(s)}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nall investors must all agree on the same \\(\\pi^* (s)\\).\n\n\nLinking Two Pricing Models\nComparing the consumption pricing model:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  p &= \\E[mx] \\\\\n  &= \\sum_s \\pi(s) m(s) x(s) \\\\\n  &= \\frac{\\E[x]}{R^f} + \\sigma(m,x)\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nWith the contingent claim pricing model:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  p &= \\sum_s pc(s) x(s) \\\\\n  &= \\frac{\\E^* [x]}{R^f}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe can see that in addition to making risk adjustments to real-world probabilities, we can also discount the payoff directly as if we are in risk-neutral world. This makes sense intuitively if we consider:\n\nthe marginal investor in the economy can shift their risk preferences (hence hypothetically they can be risk-neutral)\nthe asset price has to be unanimously agreed upon (to reach an equilibrium) regardless of the marginal investor’s risk preference\nthus we can calculate directly the asset pricing as if everyone’s in the risk-neutral world",

Net Operating Losses (NOL) can be used to offset this gain for tax purposes and cannot be transfered to acquirer.\nAcquirer Firm:\n\nRecognize purchase price as the new tax basis.\nIn turn raises depreciation/amortization expenses (valuable to acquirer).\nNo DTL adjustments because tax/book value are re-aligned.\nGoodwill is amortized over 15 years for tax purposes (but not for book purposes).\n\nTarget Shareholders: are taxed if proceeds from the asset sale are distributed. If all proceeds are distibuted, the taxable gain is then (value distributed - stock tax basis).\n\n*Exception: target subsidiary is more than 80% owned by another corporation.\n\n\nThis creates double taxation on the purchase price by target firm and target shareholder!\n\n\nTaxable Stock Purchases (without \\(\\S\\) 338)\nIn this type of purchases, the acquirer purchases shares directly from target shareholders, paying with cash.\n\nTarget Shareholder\nSeller of target stocks incur capital gains tax (CGT, sale price - outside tax basis) with corresponding tax rate:\n\nlong-term CGT rates: typically 20%\nshort-term CGT rates: marginal ordinary income tax rate\n\n\n\nAcquirer\nAcquirer then establish a new tax basis on the stock equal to the sale price.

We will introduce three types of nontaxable acquisitions in this section.\nTo begin with, under nontaxable acquisitions, shares cannot be taxed until capital gains are realized. However, there are parts of offer rendered with cash that constitutes additional tax considerations.\n\nMerger (A Reorganization)\nAn A Reorganization normally features:\n\napproval of target shareholders (typically at least simple majority, depends on state laws and company charter)\ntax-free treatment for target shareholders\ntarget shareholders must receive substantial part consideration for target shares in acquirer stock (of any form, at least 50%)\ntarget shareholders can also receive boot (taxable cash/debt)\n\nWe have to take the taxable boot into account. Under this deal structure, the taxable gain is calculated with:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  \\min\\{\\text{boot}, \\text{realized gain}\\}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nExample. If T shareholder realize a gain of $ 500 on the acquisition, with the boot in cash of $ 400, the tax basis is then: \\(\\min\\{500, 400\\} = 400\\).\n\n\nSummary Table\nWe won’t be discussing other acquisition types in detail, but here’s a summary table for all types of nontaxable acquisitions.\n\n\n\n\nA Reorg.\nB Reorg.\nC Reorg.\n\n\n\n\nAcq.

Losses reduce the goodwill account and affect the income statement.\n\n\n\nDeferred Tax Liability (DTL)\n\nDefinition: DTL arises from differences between book values (after fair value write-ups) and tax bases of assets.\n\\[\\text{DTL} = \\text{Asset Write-Up} \\times \\text{Tax Rate}\\]\nImpact:\n\nCreates a liability on the opening balance sheet.\n\nReduces over time as the gap between tax depreciation and book depreciation narrows.\n\nReverses fully by the end of the depreciation period.\n\nExample:\nIf the write-up is $50M and the tax rate is 40%,\n\\[\\text{DTL} = 50 \\times 0.4 = 20\\]\nRelevance:\nDTL increases goodwill, as it represents a liability assumed in the transaction.\n\n\n\nOpening Balance Sheet\n\nAdjustments:\n\nConsolidate the acquirer’s and target’s balance sheets.\n\nWrite up target’s assets to fair value.\n\nAdd goodwill and DTL.\n\nRecord transaction financing (e.g., new debt issuance).\n\nSteps:\n\nStart with standalone balance sheets.\n\nAdd purchase price allocation:\n\nWrite-ups for tangible/intangible assets.\n\nGoodwill creation.\n\nDTL adjustment.\n\n\nInclude transaction fees and financing adjustments.\n\nExample:\nAcquirer pays $300M in cash and issues $200M in stock.

One assumption that has to be satisfied is the investor is able to trade arbitrarily-small \\(\\xi\\) units of asset.\nHere’s a list of assumptions that the general consumption-based pricing do not assume:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssumption\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nComplete Markets\nMeasures individual-level willingness to pay, everyone can have different \\(p\\) under incomplete markets\n\n\nSpecific Return Distribution\nCan take any return distribution\n\n\nRepresentative/Marginal Investor\nThe SDF can be heterogenous to measure different types of investors\n\n\nSpecific Utility Functions\nCan take any form form of utility functions\n\n\nMarket Equilibrium\nWillingness to pay do not need market equilibrium to exist\n\n\n2-Period Model\nCan be expanded to multi-period form (later on)\n\n\nSpecific Beginning Endowment\nCan take any level of endowment\n\n\n\n\n\nReaching Equilibrium\nIn much rigor terms, \\(p\\) denotes individual investor’s willingness to pay to an asset. From above we know that the market does not have to be in eqilibrium for using the consumption-based pricing.\nWe will show now that, nevertheless, the market will finally be in congruent with the individual willingness to pay, reaching an equilibrium.\nTo begin with, purchasing \\(\\xi\\) units of asset in extra will increase the utility in the future by (discounted to today):\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  & \\beta \\E [u(c_{t+1} + \\xi x_{t+1}) - u(c_{t+1})] \\\\\n  = & \\beta \\E [u'(c_{t+1}) \\, \\xi x_{t+1} + ...]\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nFor an arbitrarily small \\(\\xi\\), only the first-order Taylor Expansion matters.\nSimilarly, purchasing \\(\\xi\\) units of asset will decrease today’s consumption. Using first-order Taylor expansion:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  & u(c_t - \\xi v_t) \\\\\n  = & u'(c_t) \\xi v_t + ...\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nOptimality is reached if the investor is indifferent to buy additional \\(\\xi\\) units of asset.

    "text": "Mean-Variance Frontier (Hansen-Jagannathan Bounds)\n\nDerivation\nGiven an asset’s riskiness, is there a reasonable bound for the return of the asset? We will try to derive the mean-variance frontier from our consumption pricing model.\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  1 &= \\E [mR^i] \\\\\n  &= \\E[m] \\E[R^i] + \\sigma(m, R^i) \\\\\n  &= \\frac{\\E[R^i]}{R^f} + \\rho (m, R^i) \\sigma(m) \\sigma(R^i)\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nRewriting the equation we would have:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  \\E [R^i] - R^f &= - R^f \\rho (m, R^i) \\sigma(m) \\sigma(R^i) \\\\\n  R^f = \\frac{1}{\\E[m]} \\implies \\E [R^i] - R^f &= - \\rho (m, R^i) \\frac{\\sigma(m)}{\\E[m]} \\sigma(R^i)\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nBy Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  \\mid \\E [R^i] - R^f \\mid &\\leq \\frac{\\sigma(m)}{\\E[m]} \\sigma(R^i)\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nGraphical Illustration\n\n\n\nSample Mean-Variance Frontier\n\n\nAssets on the upper bound:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  \\E [R^i] &= R^f + \\frac{\\sigma(m)}{\\E[m]} \\sigma(R^i)\n\\end{aligned}\\] implies the correlation \\(\\rho(m, R^i) = -1\\). The asset return has perfect negative correlation with the SDF (hence perfect positive correlation with consumption). These types of asset bring higher volatility to consumption, thus investors would require a much higher excess return. One example would be stocks that goes high when market is bullist and plummets when market is bearish.\nThe lower bound, on the opposite,\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  \\E [R^i] &= R^f - \\frac{\\sigma(m)}{\\E[m]} \\sigma(R^i)\n\\end{aligned}\\] describes assets with high returns when consumptions are low. Consider insurances: normal investors would not require a high excess return on insurance products generally, as long as they can use these products to smoothen consumption levels across time and states.\n\n\nIllustration\nWe can compare assets within the wedge-shaped mean-variance frontier through two ways:\n\nHorizontally. If two assets (their corresponding points in the graph) lies under one horizontal line, then they have the same expected returns (\\(\\E[R^i]\\)). The asset on the left has lower overall risk (\\(\\sigma(R^i)\\)) which can be attributed to idiosyncratic risks.\n\nVertically. If two assets (their corresponding points in the graph) lies under one vertical line, then they have the same overall risk. The one that has a higher expected return (on the top) has a higher consumption-payoff correlation.\n\n\n\nSharpe Ratio\nThe Sharpe ratio measures the excess return (per unit of risk) and is defined as:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  \\frac{\\E[R^i] - R^f}{\\sigma(R^i)}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nWe can connect Sharpe ratio with the mean-variance frontier:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  \\mid \\frac{\\E[R^i] - R^f}{\\sigma(R^i)} \\mid &\\leq \\frac{\\sigma(m)}{\\E[m]}\n\\end{aligned}\\] Intuition: the slope of the mean-variance frontier wedge is the maximum Sharpe ratio available.",

These types of risks do not need to be adjusted by the market-wise SDF, as it is already implied by cash flow across states.\nsystematic risks are payoff risks correlated with market conditions (consumptions).

This means that the asset has a higher return when consumption growth is high (good state) and vice versa. This makes consumption even more volatile and has to compensate investors.\nA lower excess return is required if \\(\\sigma_{u'(c_{t+1}), R^i}\\) is positive.\nConsider insurance products that pays when consumption growth is small (bad state) and do not pay vice versa. Since these products smooth consumption, we do not need additional incentive for investors to hold on to this asset.",

The algorithm, in a nutshell, does the following:\n\nFix a positive and arbitrary value for \\(\\mu_1\\). Then take uneducated guesses for all other \\(\\mu_i\\).\nSolve the allocation equation for \\(c^1\\). For all possible histories \\(s^t\\):\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{i} \\left(u_i' \\right)^{-1} \\left(\\frac{\\mu_i}{\\mu_1} u'_1 \\left(c_t^1(s^t) \\right)\\right) &= \\sum_i y_t^i (s^t)\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nSolve all remaining \\(c^i\\) through: \\[\\begin{aligned}\nc_t^i(s^t) &= \\left(u_i' \\right)^{-1} \\left(\\frac{\\mu_i}{\\mu_1} u'_1 \\left(c_t^1(s^t) \\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nThen solve the price system using the equilibrium allocation \\(c^i\\) for all \\(s^t\\) through: \\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\beta^t u_i'\\left(c_t^i (s^t) \\right) \\pi_t(s^t) = \\mu_i q_t^0(s^t)\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\nFor all \\(i \\in I\\) check the budget constraint: \\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_t \\sum_{s^t} q_t^0(s^t) \\left(y_t^i (s^t) - c_t^i (s^t) \\right) \\geq 0\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nRaise \\(\\mu_i\\) if cost of consumption exceeds endowment, vice versa.\nReiterate the algorithm until the budget constraint is binding for all consumer and histories.\n\n\n\nCRRA Utility Function\nIf we were to assume all consumers in this economy to have CRRA utility function: \\(u(c) = (1/1-\\gamma) c^{1-\\gamma}\\), then the optimality condition from the FOC implies:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  \\frac{u_i'\\left(c_t^i(s^t)\\right)}{u_j'\\left(c_t^j(s^t)\\right)} &= \\frac{\\mu_i}{\\mu_j} \\\\\n  \\implies \\left[c_t^i(s^t)\\right]^{-\\gamma} &= \\left[c_t^j(s^t)\\right]^{-\\gamma} \\frac{\\mu_i}{\\mu_j} \\\\\n  \\implies c_t^i(s^t) &= c_t^j(s^t) \\left[\\frac{\\mu_i}{\\mu_j}\\right]^{-\\frac{1}[\\gamma]}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nIt is surprising that under CRRA utility, agent \\(i\\) consumes the constant, history-independent fraction of agent \\(j\\)’s consumption! Nevertheless, we still need the feasibility constraint for every :\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  \\sum_i y_t^i(s^t) &= \\sum_i c_t^i(s^t) \\\\\n  &= c_t^i(s^t) \\left(1 + \\sum_{i} \\left[\\frac{\\mu_{-i}}{\\mu_i}\\right]^{-\\frac{1}{\\gamma}}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nIf we denote \\(\\overline{y}_t(s^t) = \\sum_i y_t^i(s^t)\\), then:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  c_t^1(s^t) &= \\overline{y}_t(s^t) \\left(1 + \\sum_{i \\in I \\setminus \\{1\\}} \\left[\\frac{\\mu_{i}}{\\mu_1}\\right]^{-\\frac{1}{\\gamma}}\\right)^{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nIf we denote:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  Z &:= \\left(1 + \\sum_{i \\in I \\setminus \\{1\\}} \\left[\\frac{\\mu_{i}}{\\mu_1}\\right]^{-\\frac{1}{\\gamma}}\\right)^{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\\] then: \\[\\begin{aligned}\n  c_t^i(s^t) &= c_t^1(s^t) \\left[\\frac{\\mu_{i}}{\\mu_1}\\right]^{-\\frac{1}{\\gamma}} = \\left[\\frac{\\mu_{i}}{\\mu_1}\\right]^{-\\frac{1}{\\gamma}} Z \\, \\overline{y}_t(s^t) \\\\\n  &= \\alpha_i \\overline{y}_t(s^t)\n\\end{aligned}\\] where:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  \\alpha_i &:= \\left[\\frac{\\mu_{i}}{\\mu_1}\\right]^{-\\frac{1}{\\gamma}} Z\n\\end{aligned}\\] is consumer \\(i\\)’s history indenpendent fixed consumption share of the aggregate endowment.\nFor the price system, we can derive further from the FOC condition:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  q_t^0 (s^t) &= \\frac{1}{\\mu_i} \\beta^t \\pi_t(s^t) \\left[c_t^i(s^t)\\right]^{-\\gamma} \\\\\n  &= \\frac{1}{\\mu_i} \\beta^t \\pi_t(s^t) \\left[\\alpha_i \\overline{y}_t (s^t) \\right]^{-\\gamma}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nAfter we normalize the time \\(0\\) state price:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  q_0^0 (s^0) &= \\frac{1}{\\mu_i} \\left[\\alpha_i \\overline{y}_t (s^t) \\right]^{-\\gamma} = 1\n\\end{aligned}\\] we can have the price system for the competitive equilibrium.\nBut how to solve for \\(\\alpha\\)? We can use budget constraint for each consumer to solve for it: \\[\\begin{aligned}\n  0 &= \\sum_t \\sum_{s^t} q_t^0 (s^t) \\left[y_t^i (s^t) - c_t^i (s^t)\\right] \\\\\n  &= \\sum_t \\sum_{s^t} q_t^0 (s^t) \\left[y_t^i (s^t) - \\alpha_i \\overline{y}_t(s^t)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\\] The budget constraint yields:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  \\alpha_i &= \\frac{\\sum_t \\sum_{s^t} q_t^0 (s^t) y_t^i (s^t)}{\\sum_t \\sum_{s^t} q_t^0 (s^t) \\overline{y}_t(s^t)}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nRiskless Aggregate Endowment\nWe will show subsequently that riskless aggregate endowment implies that consumption-per-consumer is time and history independent.\nStarting from the binding feasibility constraint:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  \\sum_{i} \\left(u_i' \\right)^{-1} \\left(\\frac{\\mu_i}{\\mu_1} u'_1 \\left(c_t^1(s^t) \\right)\\right) = \\overline{y}_t (s^t)\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nThen since \\(\\frac{\\mu_i}{\\mu_1}\\) is time and history independent, a constant \\(\\overline{y}_t (s^t)\\) implies a constant \\(c_t^1(s^t)\\). Also from\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  c_t^i(s^t) &= \\left(u_i' \\right)^{-1} \\left(\\frac{\\mu_i}{\\mu_1} u'_1 \\left(c_t^1(s^t) \\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nwe know that \\(c_t^i(s^t)\\) is also a constant for \\(i \\in I\\). Therefore, the equilibrium allocation satisfies:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  c_t^i(s^t) &= \\overline{c}^i\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nfor all possible time and history.\nHow to solve the competitive equilibrium then? We can again start from the FOC:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  \\beta^t u_i'\\left(c_t^i (s^t) \\right) \\pi_t(s^t) &= \\mu_i q_t^0(s^t) \\\\\n  \\implies q_t^0(s^t) &= \\frac{1}{\\mu_i} \\beta^t u_i'\\left(\\overline{c}^i\\right) \\pi_t(s^t)\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nAfter regularization of prices \\(\\mu_i = u_i'(\\overline{c}^i)\\), we can derive further using the budget constraint:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  0 &= \\sum_t \\sum_{s^t} q_t^0(s^t) \\left(\\overline{c}^i - y_t^i(s^t)\\right) \\\\\n  &= \\sum_t \\sum_{s^t} \\frac{1}{\\mu_i} \\beta^t u_i'\\left(\\overline{c}^i\\right) \\pi_t(s^t) \\left(\\overline{c}^i - y_t^i(s^t)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nSince \\(\\mu_i\\) and \\(u_i'\\left(\\overline{c}^i\\right)\\) are strictly positive, we can solve for \\(\\overline{c}^i\\):\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  \\overline{c}^i &= \\frac{\\sum_t \\sum_{s^t} \\beta^t \\pi_t(s^t) y_t^i(s^t)}{\\sum_t \\sum_{s^t} \\beta^t \\pi_t(s^t)} \\\\\n  &= \\frac{\\sum_t \\sum_{s^t} \\beta^t \\pi_t(s^t) y_t^i(s^t)}{\\sum_t \\beta^t \\sum_{s^t} \\pi_t(s^t)} \\\\\n  &= \\frac{\\sum_t \\sum_{s^t} \\beta^t \\pi_t(s^t) y_t^i(s^t)}{\\sum_t \\beta^t \\times 1} \\\\\n  &= (1-\\beta) \\left[\\sum_t \\sum_{s^t} \\beta^t \\pi_t(s^t) y_t^i(s^t)\\right] \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nIt is tedious but straightforward to verify that \\(\\sum_i \\overline{c}^i = \\overline{y}\\).",

Then \\(z \\in c(\\{x,z\\})\\) contradicts WARP.\nHence, \\((x,z) \\in R_c\\), and \\(R_c\\) is transitive.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.

First, for upper bound \\(h^t\\): \\[\\begin{aligned}\n     \\forall k &gt; 0&, \\forall q_2 \\in [l^t, h^t] \\\\\n     u_1(h, q_2) &&gt; u_1(h + k, q_2)\\\\\n     \\\\\n    \\implies \\quad h (1 - h - q_2) &&gt; (h + k) (1 - (h + k) - q_2) \\\\\n    \\\\\n    \\implies \\quad h &&gt; \\frac{1 - q_2 - k}{2} \\\\\n    &\\geq \\frac{1 - l^t - 0}{2} = \\frac{1 - l^t}{2}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nFor lower bound \\(l^t\\), given that \\(h^t \\leq \\frac{1 - l^t}{2}\\), \\[\\begin{aligned}\n    \\forall k &gt; 0&, \\forall q_2 \\in [l^t, \\frac{1 - l^t}{2}] \\\\\n    u_1(l, q_2) &&gt; u_1(l - k, q_2)\\\\\n    \\\\\n    \\implies \\quad l (1 - l - q_2) &&gt; (l - k) (1 - (l - k) - q_2) \\\\\n    \\\\\n    \\implies \\quad l &&lt; \\frac{1 - q_2 - k}{2} \\\\\n    &\\leq \\frac{1 - \\frac{1 - l^t}{2} - 0}{2} = \\frac{1 + l^t}{4}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nIf \\(l^t\\) converges to \\(\\overline{l}\\) when \\(t \\to + \\infty\\), then: \\[\\begin{aligned}\n    & \\overline{l} = \\frac{1 + \\overline{l}}{4} \\\\\n    \\implies \\quad & \\overline{l} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nIf \\(h^t\\) converges to \\(\\overline{h}\\) when \\(t \\to + \\infty\\), then we would have by substituting \\(\\overline{l} = 1/3\\): \\[\\begin{aligned}\n    & \\overline{h} = \\frac{1 - 1/3}{2} \\\\\n    \\implies \\quad & \\overline{h} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nThis is similarly true for \\(q_2\\). Hence, this gives a Nash equilibrium of: \\[\\begin{aligned}\n    q_1^* = q_2^* = 1/3\n\\end{aligned}\\]",

    "text": "Example: All-Pay Auctions\nIn all-pay auctions, all bidders pay for its their own bid and the highest bidder wins. Let’s consider this example to see:\n\nit is strictly dominated that a person bids above its own valuation,\nthere are no pure strategy Nash Equilibrium in this game,\nthere exists one mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium in this game.\n\nSetting:\n\nPlayer A and player B enters the room with initial balance \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (\\(a, b &gt; 100\\));\nThey are bidding over a one-hundred dollar bill;\nThey only care about the amount of cash they will carry when they leave;\nPlayer A’s vNM utility function for \\(x\\) dollars is \\(u_A(x)\\), player B’s vNM utility function for \\(x\\) dollars is \\(u_B(x)\\). Both functions are strictly increasing and concave (\\(u' &gt; 0, u'' &lt; 0\\)).\n\n\n\nClick to Explore\n\n\nBidding over $100 is strictly dominated.\n\nI argue that bidding over ($100 bid $ \\(100 + k\\) where \\(k &gt; 0\\) is arbitrarily small) is strictly dominated by bidding $ 0 for both players. For Ann: \\[\\begin{aligned}\n  x &=\n  \\begin{cases}\n  a, & b_A = 0\\\\\n  a - k, & b_A = 100 + k \\text{ and A wins}\\\\\n  a - k - 100, & b_A = 100 + k \\text{ and A loses}\\\\\n  \\end{cases}\n  \\\\\n  & \\quad a &gt; a - k &gt; a - 100 - k \\quad \\forall k &gt; 0 \\\\\n  u' &gt; 0 \\implies & u_A(a) &gt; u_A(a-k) &gt; u_A(a-100-k) \\quad \\forall k &gt; 0\n\\end{aligned}\\] Similarly for Bob: \\[\\begin{aligned}\n  u' &gt; 0 \\implies & u_B(b) &gt; u_B(b-k) &gt; B(b-100-k) \\quad \\forall k &gt; 0\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\nThere are no pure strategy NE.\n\nI argue that there exists no pure Nash eqilibrium. Try that\n\n\\(0 &lt; b_A &lt; b_B \\leq 100\\). A has a profitable deviation of \\(b_A' = b_B\\) to win the auction.\n\\(0 &lt; b_B \\leq b_A \\leq 100\\). B has a profitable deviation of \\(b_B' = 0\\) to minimize loss.\n\\(0 = b_A &lt; b_B \\leq 100\\). B has a profitable deviation of \\(b_B' = 0\\) to minimize loss.\n\\(0 = b_B &lt; b_A \\leq 100\\). A has a profitable deviation of \\(b_A' = 0\\) to win the auction at the lowest cost possible.\n\\(0 = b_B = b_A\\). B has a profitable deviation of \\(b_B' = b_A + \\epsilon, \\forall \\epsilon &gt; 0\\) to win the action.\n\n\nThere exists a mixed strategy NE.\n\nI argue that (\\(F(b_A), F(b_B)\\)), where \\(F: \\BB{R} \\to [0,1]\\) is an uniform c.d.f. of both player, is the mixed Nash equilibrium.\nThe distribution must be uniform throughout the support \\([0, 100]\\) because the indifference condition requires that all bids yield the same expected utility, which is only satisfied when the probability of each bid in the range is spread evenly, ensuring no bid offers a higher or lower payoff than another.\nSince A has \\(a\\) in her pocket already and she is indifferent in placing a bid \\(b_A \\in [0, 100]\\), then she must has a \\(a\\) of expected wealth level. Given that B is randomizing his actions with an uniform distribution \\(b_B \\sim U[0,100]\\): \\[\\begin{aligned}\n  U_A(b_A, F) &= u_A(a - b_A) + u_A(100) \\BB{P}\\{b_B \\leq b_A\\}\\\\\n  &= u_A(a - b_A) + u_A(100) F(b_A)\n\\end{aligned}\\] We need: \\[\\begin{aligned}\n  & u_A(a - b_A) + u_A(100) F(b_A) = u_A(a) \\\\\n  \\implies \\quad & F(b_A) = \\frac{u_A(a) - u_A(a - b_A)}{u_A(100)}\n\\end{aligned}\\] Hence: \\[\\begin{aligned}\n  F(b_A) =\n  \\begin{cases}\n      0 &, b_A &lt; 0 \\\\\n      \\frac{u_A(a) - u_A(a - b_A)}{u_A(100)} &, 0 \\leq b_A \\leq 100 \\\\\n      1 &, b_A &gt; 100\n  \\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nSimilarly for B: \\[\\begin{aligned}\n  F(b_B) =\n  \\begin{cases}\n      0 &, b_B &lt; 0 \\\\\n      \\frac{u_B(b) - u_B(b - b_B)}{u_B(100)} &, 0 \\leq b_B \\leq 100 \\\\\n      1 &, b_B &gt; 100\n  \\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nThus, \\((F(b_A), F(b_B))\\) is a mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium.",
