### Recap: Finite Chocices
- $$X = \mathbb{R}^n_+$$ be finite choices
- $$c: P(X) \to X$$ be the choice function
- $$\succsim$$ be the preference relation
- $$U: \mathbb{R}^n_+ \to \mathbb{R}$$ be the corresponding utility function.


#### What if Choices Become Infinite
##### Different Levels of Finite
- Finite: there exists a bijection $$X \leftrightarrow \{1, ..., n\}$$.
      - each $$x \in X$$ is paired with exactly one number in $$\{1, ..., n\}$$
      - each number in $$\{1, ..., n\} is paired with exactly one $$x \in X$$
      - nobody is left unpaired
- Countably Infinite: there exists a bijection $$X \leftrightarrow \mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, ...\}$$. Below are number sets by their finiteness
      - $$\mathbb{Z} = \{..., -1, 0, 1, ...\}$$ is countably infinite
      - $$\mathbb{Q} = \{a/b: a \in \mathbb{Z}, b \in \mathbb{N}\}$$ is countably infinite
      - $$\mathbb{R}$$ is not countably infinite

##### Countable Infinite
**Proposition.** $$\succsim$$ be a rational preference and $$X$$ be a countable set $$\Rightarrow$$ there exists $$U: X \to \mathbb{R}$$ representing $$\succsim$$.
***Proof.*** 

Consider 
- a countable choice set: $$X = \{x_1, ..., x_n, ...\}$$.
- a weight indicator: $$d_j = \frac{1}{2^j}$$. 
We would have
$$\begin{aligned}
      \Sigma_{j=1}^{\infty} d_j = \Sigma_{j=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^j} = \lim_{n \to \infty} [\Sigma_{j = 1}^n \frac{1}{2^j}] = 1
\end{aligned}$$

We can define the utility function $$U: X \to \mathbb{R}$$ as
$$\begin{aligned}
      U(z) = \Sigma_{\{j \in \mathbb{N}: (z, x_j) \in \succsim\}} d_j
\end{aligned}$$

##### Incountable Infinite
It is not always true that there exists a utility function $$U: X \to \mathbb{R}$$ to represent a rational $$\succsim$$.
E.g. Bowser Jr.'s Lexicographic Preferences ($$X = \mathbb{R}^2_+$$).

We would need some other properties that $$\succsim$$ must satisfy to make the utility function possible.

### Continuous Preference Relation
Definition: for all pairs $$x,y \in X$$ with $$x \succ y$$, we can always find $$\epsilon > 0$$ such that:
- $$|x - x'| < \epsilon$$
- $$|y - y'| < \epsilon$$

implies $$x' \succ y'$$.

Intuition: a strictly preferred pair should remain their preference status even under a sligtest change in any direction. We would not expect a rational person to freak out if a slightest change takes place.

#### Utility Representation
**Proposition.** If $$\succsim$$ is complete, transitive, and continuous, then there exists a continuous $$U: \mathbb{R}^n_+ \to \mathbb{R}$$ that represents $$\succsim$$.
